## Basics â€“ File & Directory Operations

```bash
pwd                     # Print current directory
ls                      # List directory contents
ls -la                  # Long listing incl. hidden files
cd /path/to/dir         # Change directory
cd ~                    # Home directory
cd -                    # Previous directory
cd ..                   # Up one directory
mkdir newfolder         # Create folder
touch file.txt          # Create empty file
cp source dest          # Copy files or directories
mv old new              # Move/rename
rm file.txt             # Delete file
rm -rf folder/          # Recursively delete folder (dangerous)
```

## Search, Filters, and Viewing

```bash
nano file.txt           # Open file in nano text editor
cat file.txt            # View file contents
less file.txt           # Scrollable file viewer
head -n 10 file.txt     # First 10 lines
tail -n 10 file.txt     # Last 10 lines
grep "text" file.txt    # Search text in file
find . -name "*.log"    # Find all .log files from current dir
```

---

## Sorting and Counting

```bash
sort filename.txt | uniq                         # Remove duplicate lines
sort filename.txt | uniq -c                      # Count occurrences of each unique line
sort filename.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr           # Count and sort by most frequent
cat filename.txt | grep -i "Search" | sort | uniq  # Filter, sort, then remove duplicates
```

---

## System Info & Processes

```bash
top                     # Real-time system monitor
ps aux                  # List all running processes
ps -ef | grep name      # Search process list
uptime                  # System uptime
whoami                  # Current user
hostname                # System hostname
sw_vers                 # macOS version
```

## Network Commands

```bash
ifconfig                # Network interfaces
netstat -an             # Network connections
lsof -i :port           # Processes using a specific port
ping 8.8.8.8            # ICMP test
curl http://example.com # Fetch content from URL
dig domain.com          # DNS lookup
```

---

## Permissions & Ownership

```bash
chmod +x script.sh      # Make file executable
chmod 755 file          # rwxr-xr-x (owner can write/execute)
chown user:group file   # Change file owner
sudo su                 # Switch to root (if enabled)
sudo -s                 # Root shell
```

---

## App & Service Management

```bash
open .                  # Open Finder at current path
open file.pdf           # Open with default app
open -a "App Name"      # Open app from CLI
killall Safari          # Kill app by name
pkill -f processname    # Kill by process string match
```

---

## Package Managers

```bash
brew install packagename       # Install software
brew update && brew upgrade    # Update packages
brew list                      # List installed packages
brew uninstall packagename     # Remove package
```

## Gatekeeper, SIP & Security Controls

> These can weaken system security. Use with understanding and caution.

```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute from downloaded files (Safer then below)
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/script  

# Disable Gatekeeper
sudo spctl --master-disable

# Check Gatekeeper status
sudo spctl --status

# Re-enable Gatekeeper
sudo spctl --master-enable
```

> Must be done from Recovery Mode to disable SIP:

```bash
# Disable SIP
csrutil disable

# Re-enable SIP
csrutil enable
```

```bash
# Disable TCC for a specific app (not recommended unless testing)
tccutil reset All com.app.bundleid
```

---

## Scripting & Automation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello macOS"

# Make script executable and run
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

---

## Hidden Files & System Files

```bash
# Show hidden files
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true
killall Finder

# Hide hidden files
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false
killall Finder
```

---

## Disk & Mounting

```bash
diskutil list                     # List all disks/partitions
diskutil mount /dev/disk2s1      # Mount disk
diskutil unmount /dev/disk2s1    # Unmount disk
```

## Passwords & Keychain

```bash
security find-generic-password -ga "accountname"  # Show saved password (may prompt)
```
