This regex reference outlines essential components for pattern matching, capturing, and string manipulation, drawn from DaveChildâ€™s widely used Regular Expressions cheat sheet, but adapted for security analysts, blue teamers, and SOC professionals.

## The Basics

```
.       # Any character except newline
*       # 0 or more of the previous
+       # 1 or more of the previous
?       # 0 or 1 of the previous
|       # OR operator
()      # Group expressions
[]      # Character class
[^]     # Negated character class
{n,m}   # Repeat n to m times
\d      # Digit (0-9)
\w      # Word character (a-zA-Z0-9_)
\s      # Whitespace
\.      # Escape literal dot with \.
```

## Common IOC Search Patterns

```
https?:\/\/[\w.-]+(?:\/[\w\/._%-]*)?                # Website
[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]       # Email address
\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b                         # IPv4 address
([a-fA-F0-9]{1,4}:){7}[a-fA-F0-9]{1,4}              # IPv6 address
[A-Z]:\\(?:[\w\s.-]+\\)*[\w\s.-]+                   # Windows path
\/(?:[\w.-]+\/)*[\w.-]+                             # Unix/Linux path
(["'])([\w\/]+)\1                                   # Variables from scripts
(?:[A-Za-z0-9+/]{4}){2,}(?:==|=)?                   # Base64
```

## Tooling Tips

- Use `regex101.com` or **CyberChef** for testing and debugging.
- Double-escape backslashes (`\\`) when pasting into JSON/Sigma rules.
- Use SIEM-specific syntax for anchors (e.g., `^`, `$` may not always be needed).
- Be cautious with overly greedy expressions in detection logic.

## Advanced Patterns 
---
Content adapted from DaveChild | More at [https://cheatography.com/](https://cheatography.com/davechild/)
### Anchors  

```
^       Start of string, or start of line in multi-line mode  
\A      Start of string  
$       End of string, or end of line in multi-line mode  
\Z      End of string  
\b      Word boundary  
\B      Not word boundary  
\<      Start of word  
\>      End of word  
```

---

### Character Classes  
```
\c      Control character  
\s      Whitespace  
\S      Not whitespace  
\d      Digit  
\D      Not digit  
\w      Word character  
\W      Not word character  
\x      Hexadecimal digit  
\O      Octal digit  
```

---

### POSIX Character Classes  
```
[:upper:]     Uppercase letters  
[:lower:]     Lowercase letters  
[:alpha:]     All letters  
[:alnum:]     Digits and letters  
[:digit:]     Digits  
[:xdigit:]    Hexadecimal digits  
[:punct:]     Punctuation  
[:blank:]     Space and tab  
[:space:]     Blank characters  
[:cntrl:]     Control characters  
[:graph:]     Printed characters (no space)  
[:print:]     Printed characters and spaces  
[:word:]      Digits, letters and underscore  
```

---

### Assertions  
```ruby
(?=...)       Lookahead assertion  
(?!...)       Negative lookahead  
(?<=...)      Lookbehind assertion  
(?<!...)      Negative lookbehind (also written as ?!=)  
(?>...)       Once-only subexpression  
(?(cond)...)  Condition [if then]  
(?(cond)...|...)  Condition [if then else]  
(?#...)       Comment  
```

---

### Quantifiers  
```markdown
*        0 or more  
+        1 or more  
?        0 or 1  
{3}      Exactly 3  
{3,}     3 or more  
{3,5}    3, 4 or 5  
*? +? ?? {n,m}?  Add ? to make it ungreedy  
```

---

### Escape Sequences  
```pgsql
\        Escape the following character  
\Q       Begin literal sequence  
\E       End literal sequence  
```
> Escaping allows treating special regex characters as literals.

---

### Common Metacharacters  
```ruby
^ [ . $ { * ( \ + ) | ? < >
```
> Escape them with `\` when used literally.

---

### Special Characters  
```pgsql
\n       New line  
\r       Carriage return  
\t       Tab  
\v       Vertical tab  
\f       Form feed  
\xxx     Octal character xxx  
\xhh     Hex character hh  
```

---

### Groups and Ranges  
```less
.           Any character except newline (\n)  
(a|b)       a or b  
(...)       Capturing group  
(?:...)     Non-capturing group  
[abc]       a or b or c  
[^abc]      Not a, b or c  
[a-q]       Lowercase a to q  
[A-Q]       Uppercase A to Q  
[0-7]       Digit 0 to 7  
\1, \2, ... Refer to matched group 1, 2, etc.  
```
> Ranges are inclusive.

---

### Pattern Modifiers (Flags)  
```vbnet
g    Global match  
i    Case-insensitive  
m    Multi-line mode  
s    Treat string as single line (dot matches newline)  
x    Allow comments and whitespace  
e    Evaluate replacement (rare/legacy use)  
U    Make quantifiers ungreedy by default  
```
> Flags are applied outside the pattern, like `/pattern/gi`

---

### String Replacement  
```vbnet
$n      nth non-passive group  
$1      First captured group  
$2      Second captured group  
$&      Entire matched string  
$`      Text before the match  
$'      Text after the match  
$+      Last matched group  
```
> Some engines use `\1`, `\2`, etc., instead of `$1`, `$2`.
